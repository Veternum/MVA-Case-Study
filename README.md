# Assessing the Relationship between Educational Attainment and Social Well-being in Indonesia through Canonical Correlation Analysis

## Overview

This repository hosts the unpublished paper and the associated R Markdown code for the case study titled **"Assessing the Relationship between Educational Attainment and Social Well-being in Indonesia through Canonical Correlation Analysis."** The project aims to explore and quantify the relationship between educational attainment and various indicators of social well-being in Indonesia using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).

The work was initially developed as a group project for a university assignment. I took primary responsibility for writing the paper and conducting the numerical analysis. I've shared this work on GitHub as part of my portfolio for joining the Apple Developer Academy Indonesia.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

```
/root
│── README.md          # This file
│── Case Study.Rmd     # R Markdown file with all analysis
│── Case Study.pdf     # The full text of the case study paper
│── case_data.csv      # The dataset used for analysis
```

## Methods Used

In this project, we employed the following methods and tools:

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** The dataset includes various indicators of educational attainment and social well-being. The data was cleaned and prepared using R.
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA):** CCA was applied to examine the relationship between the sets of variables representing educational attainment and social well-being.
- **Statistical Analysis & Interpretation:** The results of the CCA were analyzed to understand the strength and nature of the relationships between the variables.

## Results

The case study's key findings include:

- Insights into how different aspects of educational attainment are related to indicators of social well-being in Indonesia.
- Interpretation of the canonical correlations and their implications for policy and educational planning.

Detailed results and discussions are provided in the `CaseStudy_Education_Wellbeing.pdf` file.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Veternum/MVA-Case-Study.git
   ```

2. Open the R Markdown file (`Case Study.Rmd`) in RStudio or any text editor.

3. Run the code chunks within the R Markdown file to reproduce the analysis.

4. To compile the paper, knit the R Markdown file into a PDF or HTML format.

## Team and Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort. I was primarily responsible for the writing of the paper and the numerical analysis, while my teammates contributed to data collection, initial analysis, and interpretation.
